# Cancer_Detection_SVM
Built a model to classify cancer cells, whether the cell samples are benign or malignant by SVM.

This model helps to find out the person had cancer or not by analysing various factors. 

Projects steps:

1)Download a CSV data file of Cell Samples from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets. This dataset contains various features which can help our model for accurate prediction.

2)Identified the most relevant features with different techniques(Variance, Mutual Info. classification) to improve the predictive power of the model.

3)Developed and trained predictive models using Support Vector Machine.

4)Built a web app of that model using flask framework and deploy the model into production environment with the help of ngrok host platform.
